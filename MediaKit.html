              <p align="right" class="style1 style1"><em>When Two Become One</em> is one of the healthiest, most  Biblically-consistent and God-honoring presentations of sexuality I have ever  read.&nbsp; It will be required reading for my  students and should be required reading for every couple involved in  pre-marital or marriage counseling.&nbsp;  While there are many reasons to buy this book, the Lovemaking Cycle&copy; model alone is worth the price.&nbsp; This book is a relational investment that  will return dividends in your marriage for years to come.</p>

This is an insightful  and practical resource which will leave the reader with the feelings, &ldquo;This  makes sense.&nbsp; I can do this.&nbsp; And this can enhance our marriage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Read it for yourself, read it together, and  share it with others.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll thank you  for it.</p>

              <p align="right" class="style1 style1">This is a wonderful book that I can endorse  enthusiastically.&nbsp; It is clearly written,  interesting, Biblically-based, richly illustrated with stories, always in good  taste, and intensely practical.&nbsp; Drawing  on careful research, their own experience as a couple, and on Christopher&rsquo;s  work as a sex therapist, the McCluskeys have written an honest, helpful book  that is free of jargon and short enough to actually get read.&nbsp; I learned a lot and know that I will  recommend this book to a lot of people.&nbsp;  Read it and see for yourself.</p>

              <p class="bodystyle">My guests today are Christopher &amp; Rachel McCluskey,  authors of the highly-acclaimed book <em>When  Two Become One: Enhancing Sexual Intimacy in Marriage</em>.&nbsp; First published in 2004, the book has just  been re-released in oversized paperback.&nbsp;  Christopher is a popular speaker, professional life coach, and Christian  counselor certified in sex therapy.&nbsp; He  is a co-founder of the American Board of Christian Sex Therapists and of the  Institute for Sexual Wholeness, a master&rsquo;s level training program for Christian  counselors.&nbsp; His wife, Rachel, is also a  life coach and the homeschooling mother of their six children.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re joining me today from their ranch in  the foothills of southern Missouri.</p>
              <p class="bodystyle"><strong>You may or may not  want these few sentences about the book itself:</strong></p>
              <p class="bodystyle">The book casts a beautiful and compelling vision of marital  intimacy as God intended it.&nbsp; The most  unique feature is an innovative model called <em>The Lovemaking Cycle</em>&copy; which is now being taught in seminaries and graduate  programs in marriage counseling throughout the U.S. and overseas.&nbsp; The model suggests a picture of God&rsquo;s  three-dimensional plan for sexual union (body, soul &amp; spirit), and provides  a powerful tool for addressing problem areas that can threaten the beauty of  that plan.</p>
              <p class="bodystyle"><strong>Suggested interview  questions (for either of us, unless otherwise noted):</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li class="bodystyle">Christopher, when people discover that you are a Christian  sex therapist, how do they respond?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Why are we so reluctant to talk about sexual issues within  the church community?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">In your book, you make an immediate distinction between  &ldquo;having sex&rdquo; and truly &ldquo;making love&rdquo;.&nbsp;  How do you define the differences?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Why do you say that Christians ought to be the most sexually  fulfilled people on the planet?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Rachel, you state that sexual union is first and foremost a  means of communication.&nbsp; What do you  mean?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">You see a link between sexuality and spirituality.&nbsp; Explain that.</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Your book centers around a schematic model you have  developed called <em>The Lovemaking Cycle</em>&copy;.&nbsp; Can you give us a quick overview of the  model?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Talk to us a little about the first of the four quadrants, &ldquo;<em>Atmosphere</em>&rdquo;.</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Assuming that the atmosphere or environment within a  marriage is conducive to lovemaking, how do couples flow into the second  quadrant, &ldquo;<em>Arousal</em>&rdquo;?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">And that leads naturally to the third quadrant, &ldquo;<em>Apex</em>&rdquo;&hellip;</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Talk about this fourth and final quadrant of <em>The Lovemaking Cycle</em>&copy;, the  &ldquo;<em>Afterglow</em>&rdquo;.</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Chris, toward the end of your book, you have two chapters  that simply address several of the most frequently asked questions you receive  from men and women about sexual intimacy.&nbsp;  I noticed that men seem to struggle with the fact that their wives often  have a lower sex drive than they do.&nbsp; How  do you respond to that frustration?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Rachel, it sounds like women often struggle with their body  image.&nbsp; What help can you offer there?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">What would you say are the one or two biggest threats to  sexual intimacy as God intended it?</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">You wrap up the book by emphasizing that making love is  something a couple should be doing all day long.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve alluded to this before &ndash; say a little  more about that.</li>
                <li class="bodystyle">Your book is available in most Christian bookstores as well  as Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, Books-A-Million, Amazon, etc.&nbsp; You also have other resources available such  as a videotape on <em>The Lovemaking Cycle</em>&copy;.&nbsp; Where can people find that?</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="bodystyle"><strong>I don&rsquo;t know whether  or not you&rsquo;ll offer the book as a promotional item that people can order  through your show, or if you&rsquo;ll do any commercials at break times for the  book.&nbsp; If so, this is copy we have used  which fits into a 60-second spot:</strong></p>
              <p class="bodystyle">Sexual issues are cited as one of the primary reasons for  marital conflict and divorce.&nbsp; Finally, a  book has been written for Christian husbands and wives that blends the  physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of marriage with the  sexual.&nbsp; <em>When Two Become One: Enhancing Sexual Intimacy in Marriage</em> has been  called a &ldquo;must-read&rdquo; for couples wishing to enhance their love life.&nbsp; Written by Christian sex therapist  Christopher McCluskey and his wife, Rachel, this practical, detailed resource  offers a vision of lovemaking that facilitates a deeper experience of intimacy  on all planes of marriage.</p>
              <p class="bodystyle">The most unique feature of <em>When Two Become One</em> is <em>The  Lovemaking Cycle</em>&copy;,  an innovative model that captures the heart of truly making love (as contrasted  with simply &ldquo;having sex&rdquo;).&nbsp; The model  suggests a picture of God&rsquo;s three-dimensional plan for sexual union and  provides a powerful tool for identifying problems that can threaten the beauty  of that plan.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="bodystyle">Whether you are newly married or have been wed for decades,  now is the time to ignite the intimate, passionate love God created you to  enjoy!&nbsp; Get your copy of <em>When Two Become One</em>, available at  bookstores everywhere.</p>
              <p class="bodystyle"><strong>There are several  endorsements on the book jacket but here are a few, if needed:</strong></p>
              <p class="bodystyle">&ldquo;One of the healthiest, most biblically consistent and  God-honoring presentations of sexuality I have ever read.&rdquo;<br />

              <p class="bodystyle">&ldquo;No one brings together the spiritual and sexual parts of  marriage in as clear and meaningful a way as the McCluskeys.&rdquo;<br />
