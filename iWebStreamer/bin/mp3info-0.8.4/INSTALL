Installing MP3info from source
==============================

Unpack and decompress the archive file, then change the current working
directory to the directory created by unpacking the archive.  The following
two commands should accomplish this:

	tar -xzvf mp3info-x.y.tgz
	cd mp3info-x.y
	
Next, edit the top of the Makefile and make any changes necessary to reflect your environment.
The defaults are valid for Red Hat Linux 6.2 systems, but will probably work for many others.

Next, run the following two commands.

	make
	make install 		(this command must be run by the root user)

If you want to compile just the console or GTK version use 'make mp3info' or 
'make gmp3info' (respectively).

... and that's it. There should be a binary named mp3info and/or another named 
gmp3info in whatever the 'prefix' variable is set to in the Makefile (the 
default is /usr/local/bin)

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If 'make install' results in an error like the following:

     install: cannot create regular file `/usr/local/man/man1/mp3info.1': No such file or directory
     
you probably need to go back and edit the 'manpath' setting in the Makefile.  The manpath variable
must reflect one of your system's repositories for manual pages -- specifically for section 1 manual
pages (so specifying /foo/bar/man would not be sufficient -- you would need to specify 
/foo/bar/man/man1 or /foo/bar/man/sman1 or whatever reflects reality).

If you have trouble determining where your system's man pages are stored, try examining
your MANPATH environment variable or see man's own man page (i.e run 'man 1 man').


Installing the pre-compiled binaries
====================================
Run the following command as the root user.  Note that you must have the Redhat Package Manager (RPM)
installed.  If you don't have RPM installed on your system, you can get it from the RedHat web site
(www.redhat.com), but you will probably find it easier to build from source code.

	rpm -ivh mp3info-x.y-z.i386.rpm
	
If you are upgrading from a previous version of MP3Info, use this command:

	rpm -Uvh mp3info-x.y-z.i386.rpm
