<p><strong><img src="images/Martha-Greene.jpg" alt="martha" width="119" height="140" hspace="15" align="left" />Martha Greene is a life and spiritual formation coach</strong> who has  been encouraging others in their relationship with God for over 30 years.  Her passion is to help men and women walk  intimately with God and live in His unique calling on their lives--in every  role and with every assignment they have been given.  </p>
<p>She partners with her clients to supernaturally transform  their hearts and lives, thereby overcoming the obstacles that have kept them  from living fully alive in their relationship with God, others, and  themselves.  She coaches them through the  process of determining their purpose, discovering their passion, and designing  a plan--one that will glorify God in their lives, families, workplaces,  communities, and world. </p>
<p>Martha and her husband, Fred, live in Irvine, California  and have been married 33 years. They have two grown daughters, Lindsay and  Allison. Martha graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas  with a BA in philosophy and from The Masters Program--Strategic Life Coaching  for Leaders in God’s Kingdom.  She did  her initial coach training with The Institute for Life Coach Training and is continuing  to train with the Professional Christian Coaching Institute. Martha is a member  the Christian Coaching Network (CCN) and the International Coaching Federation  (ICF).</p>
