####################################################
# Special Perl library support settings
#
# The following setting applies to two types of 
# situations. This setting will be used by Perlshop, 
# Perlshop Office, Perlshop DBI, and most Perlshop
# Plugins.
#
#
# First, this setting can be used to support
# Perlshop installatios on web servers that do
# not have a complete Perl language library.  
# For these situations, you may need to
# install various Perl modules into your own
# account.  If this is the case, the "use lib"
# command can be used to tell Perl the location of
# the local Perl library that you have created.
#
# In the following example, all extra Perl modules
# have been installed in a directory named 'perllib',
# which is located under the primary account
# directory.
#
# Example:
# use lib '/home/youraccount/perllib';
#
#
# Second, this setting can be used to support
# Perlshop installations on web servers that do
# not execute Perl programs from the directory in
# which the perlshop.cgi file is located (IIS).
# In this situation, the "use lib" command should
# be used to tell Perl the directory where the 
# Perlshop configuration files are located.
#
# Example:
# use lib 'c:/serverroot/myaccount/cgi';
#
#
# You may have as many 'use lib' commands as you like.
#
# To add a 'use lib' command to this file, simply
# remove the leading '#' character from the following
# line, and fill in the value of the required directory.

#use lib '';


####################################################
# Web server information
$server_address		= 'www.mystore.com';

# Must be actual cgi directory name (i.e. 'cgi-bin')
$cgi_directory		= '';

# Leave blank unless the Perlshop css and js files
# are being placed in subdirectories.
# (This is not recommended)

# Email configuration information

# Email transmission mechanism
#
# Recommended setting 1:
#	'html_smtp'		This setting should work on any platform.  The Perl MIME::Lite module is required.
#				Email will be sent using the standard Perl Net::SMTP module.
#				The $smtp_addr value should be left blank, but can be used to override the default
#				SMTP server used by the Net::SMTP installation on your web server.
#
# Recommended setting 2:
#	'html_sendmail'	This setting should work on any Unix platform.  The Perl MIME::Lite module is required.
#				Email will be sent using the external sendmail program.
#				The $sendmail_loc value should be left blank, but can be used to override the default
#				behavior of the MIME::Lite installation on your web server.
#
# Other valid settings:
#	'blat'		For Windows, using external Blat program.
#				The $blat_loc setting is used to determine the location of the Blat executable.
#
#	'dv'			For Windows, using the DevMailer component from www.geocel.com.
#				The $smtp_addr and $smtp_port values must be set to the hostname or IP address of 
#				your SMTP server.
#
#	'sendmail' 		For Unix, using the external sendmail program.
#				The $sendmail_loc setting is used to specify the full file path to the sendmail executable.
#
#	'sockets' 		For any system as a last resort, using socket IO to connect to the smtp server.
#				The $smtp_addr value must be set to the hostname or IP address of your SMTP server.
#				Windows 95 requires that the IP address be used.
#
$mail_via		= 'sendmail';

# The following table describes the states to apply sales tax to.

# Values are state name and tax percentage separated by a single space.

# For the US and Canada, state names must be the standard two letter
# upper case values specified by the national postal systems.
#
# A state value of 'OTHER' can be used as an optional final entry that
# will be applied to all states not already given.
#
# Example:
# @Tax_States = ('CA 8.25', 'AZ 6.00', 'OTHER 5.00');
#
# Some states require different sales tax rates based upon the zip code
# of the billing address.  To support this need, zip codes may optionally
# be included along with the state code.  Multiple entries may be given.
# Zipcode values may be given in US 5+4 digit format. 
#
# Example:
# @Tax_States = 
# (
#	'FL:12345-6789 6.00',	# Florida, zip code 12345-6789 only
#	'FL:12345-9876 6.50',	# Florida, zip code 12345-9876 only
#	'FL:12345 7.00',	# Florida, any zip code starting with 12345 not already specified
#	'FL:23456 7.00',	# Florida, all zip codes starting with 23456

# 	@Tax_States = ();
#
# 2.	The $external_tax_table setting must be given the name of the configuration file
#	containing your tax table.  Example:
#	$external_tax_file = 'ps_florida_tax.cfg';

# The external tax file must be placed in the same directory as the perlshop.cgi file.
# The external tax file must have the same file permissions as the ps.cfg file.

#	This field is optional.  If present, it indicates

#	and decrypt your data.  Cipher Block Chaining 
#	will be used in combination with the specified
#	module.
#
#	Cipher Block Chaining requires that the Perl
#	library module named Crypt::CBC be installed on
#	your web server.  This module acts as a generic
#	interface to a wide variety of potential data
#	encryption systems.  
#
#	The following Perl cipher modules are supported:
#		- Crypt::Blowfish  (strongly recommended)
#		- Crypt::Blowfish_PP
#		- Crypt::DES
#		- Crypt::DES_EDE3
#		- Crypt::DES_PP
#		- Crypt::NULL
#		- Crypt::Serpent
#		- Crypt::TEA
#		- Crypt::Twofish
#		- Crypt::Twofish2
#
#	NOTE: If the cipher field is not defined, your data
#	will be encoded using the standard RC4 algorithm.
#	This requires that the Perl Crypt::RC4 module be
#	installed on your web server.
#
#
#	- key
#	This field is required.  This is the passphrase 
#	used by Perlshop 4 to encrypt data, and by 
#	Perlshop Office to decrypt data.
